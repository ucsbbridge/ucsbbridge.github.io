      <description>Competing in District 22&amp;rsquo;s Flight C grouping, Danning and Andrew finished second to earn $500 to travel to Columbus for the Spring NABC and the North American Pairs (NAP). In addition to being relaxing and refreshing, NAPs are the preeminent match-points games in the US every year. While the 2020 Spring NABC was one of the first victims of virus-related cancellations, Danning and Andrew look forward to competing when they are able to do so.</description>
