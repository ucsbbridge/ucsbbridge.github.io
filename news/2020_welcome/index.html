<p>There are many opportunities available for competitive bridge playing this year! If you would like to play as a sub in the Santa Barbara-area online bridge games, allowing you to play with your friends and earn masterpoints for free, reach out to Andrew (<a href="mailto:ucsbbridge@gmail.com">ucsbbridge@gmail.com</a>). In addition, the Online Junior Bridge League (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ojblsite/home?authuser=0">https://sites.google.com/view/ojblsite/home?authuser=0</a>) is hosting matches for the foreseeable future against other young bridge players. If you are a current student or under 26, you are eligible to play! Again, let Andrew know if you are interested.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more news about the ACBL&rsquo;s College Bridge Bowl qualifying matches, which will be held early next year.</p>
