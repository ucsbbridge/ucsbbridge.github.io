      <description>Hello everyone, and welcome to Year Three of the UCSB Bridge Club! I am very excited for another year filled with fun, food, friends, and finesses as we seek to build upon a wildly successful 2018-19. I have high hopes for more success this year, both in terms of growing our club and as relates to our competitive aspirations in the College Bridge Bowl. I look forward to having many of you along for the ride!</description>
