<h1 id="bridge-base">Bridge Base</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.bridgebase.com/">Bridge Base</a> is an website for playing bridge online, either with other people or robots. When playing with the robots, one can hover their mouse above a bid to have it explained. The robots play 2 over 1, the same as our club.</p>
<h2 id="college-bridge-online">College Bridge Online</h2>
<p>The College Bridge Online tournaments are daily tournaments on Bridge Base. You play at a table with 3 robots, and your scores are compared with other college players. Thus these are good for more competitive practice. ACBL membership is required. Let us know at a meeting and we can set you up for these tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="santa-barbara-bridge-center">Santa Barbara Bridge Center</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bridgewebs.com/sbbc542/">Santa Barbara Bridge Center</a> is our town&rsquo;s ACBL-sanctioned club. We go there when we want to play bridge slightly more competitively. UCSB partnerships play either the Tuesday evening or Saturday lunchtime game on a semi-regular basis subject to people&rsquo;s availability. Come to our meetings to coordinate playing with other UCSB players at the bridge center.</p>
<h1 id="american-contract-bridge-league">American Contract Bridge League</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.acbl.org">American Contract Bridge League (ACBL)</a> is the governing body for bridge in the U.S., Mexico, Canada and Bermuda. Membership is in the ACBL is required for playing both in Santa Barbara Bridge Center and also the College Bridge online tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="georgia-tech-bridge-club">Georgia Tech Bridge Club</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://bridgeclub.gtorg.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech Bridge club</a> has good advice for beginners on their website. Note that their bidding lessons teach Standard American Yellow Card (SAYC), which is not the system we typically play at UCSB Bridge club.</p>
